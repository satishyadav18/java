method overloading => It is a programming technique that allows 
multiple functions or methods to have the same name 
but different parameters or implementations 

ex: 
public class Practice{

    static int max(int x, int y){
        return x > y ? x : y;
    }

    static float max(float x, float y){
        return x > y ? x : y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(max(10, 5));

         System.out.println(max(5.25f, 7.8f));
    }
}
In the above program method names are same but method 
calls are different .

Differrent methods are called depending on parameters 
this behaviour is called Polymorphism. And we achieve 
Polymorphism with the help of method overloading.

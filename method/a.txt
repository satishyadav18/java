when the object are passed as parameter, object itself is not 
passed its reference is passed And if a method is modifying the 
object the actual object will be modified which is there in heap,
that object will be modified 



[//Practice.java]



for understanding => primitive are paased by value and objects are passed by reference 
but in java there is nothing like adress and pointer its simply parameter passing and nothing more 
we cannot name the method such as pass by val or ref.

java doesn't have different methods just it is parameter passing ...........only parmeters are 
passed so the contents are passed

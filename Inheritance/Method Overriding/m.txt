super class object
-------------------
Super su = new Super()  
su.display()   -> "Hello" 

sub class object
----------------
Sub sb = new Sub()   
sb.display()    -> "Hello World"
it priorities its own method and the super class method will be shadowed.




Dyanamic mehtod dispatch : 
------------------------    A super class refernce holding an object of sub class and overrided method
                             is called then the method of an oject is called not the method of refernce.

Super su = new Sub()    
su.display()    ->  "Hello World"

>The method will be called depending on the object(Sub) not upon the refernce.
